# Hack-Assembler

## Description

It's an assembler for the [Hack assembly language](https://www.nand2tetris.org/project04) from the [nand2tetris project](https://www.nand2tetris.org). It takes an '.asm' file - which must be in the working directory - and creates a new '.hack' file out of it. <br>
To use it, simply run 'HackAssembler.py'. <br> The 'Fill.asm' is there for trying out the assembler.
